# RiConcert app


üöÄ About the Project  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RiConcert app is a SAAS application designed to streamline concert organization and ticket purchasing. The system brings together a suite of features‚Äîfrom secure user authentication with Google to dynamic event creation and management, comprehensive organizer profiles, and interactive ratings and reviews‚Äîto create a seamless experience for both organizers and visitors.

üî¨ Project workflow 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **User Authentication & Registration**  
   Users can sign up and log in using Google authentication, ensuring a quick and secure onboarding process. First-time users will have their accounts created automatically, with role-based access for     visitors and organizers.

2. **Organizer & Venue Management**  
   Organizers can create and manage their profiles, updating key details such as venue locations, contact information, and past events. This ensures a professional and trustworthy presence on the platform.

3. **Concert Event Management**  
  Organizers can create, edit, and delete concert events through an intuitive dashboard. The system prevents conflicts like duplicate events and automatically notifies attendees of event updates or cancellations.
4. **Event Ratings & Reviews**
   After attending an event, visitors can rate and review the concert. Reviews are moderated for inappropriate content, and organizers can respond to feedback. An average rating system ensures transparency and credibility for future attendees.
5. **Continuous Deployment & Development**
   The project follows an agile development workflow with CI/CD pipelines. Automated testing ensures stability, while deployment to a staging environment allows for thorough testing before release. Each feature is developed in sprints, with regular reviews to optimize functionality and user experience.
